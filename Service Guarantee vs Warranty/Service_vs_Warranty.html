	<title>ESES Guarantee vs. Warranty</title>
</head>
<body>

		<p>Team,</p>
		<p>When a customer purchases a new stove from ESES, whether it is Pellet, Gas, or Wood, we do offer our customer’s a 45 day guarantee after install.  We are essentially telling the customer if something isn’t working right within the first 45 days, we will send a technician out Free of charge to take a look at it.  It is important for you to know this is an ESES policy.  Even though we are going out to the home for free, the manufactures warranty will NEVER cover those costs.  This is just something we do in good faith for our customers.  If the customer is outside that 45 day, they will need to pay for the Service Call.</p>

		<p>Manufactures warranty will cover parts and labor and terms will vary depending on the brand.  In most cases- parts need to be defective and replaced for warranty.  Warranty will not cover cleaning, maintenance issues, or adjustments to stoves.</p>

		<p>For anyone who had their stove installed in the “off season” their 45 days warranty would begin October 1st and expire on November 15th.   That means we can sell and install a stove in June but we do not expect the customer to use their stove until the weather turns cold.  That is why we call October 1st the start of our heating season.
		</p> 

		Thank you,
		Matt Roe
